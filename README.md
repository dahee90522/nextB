## this is my C++ 1 year project

This is the <u>consol game</u> that moving the emoji by clicking the **space bar** <br>
When I started this project I developed this file using **C language**.<br>
After half year I developed again to use **C++ language**.


I created this project by referring to the game called ***Amazing Wire***.  
The reason that I choose this game is just I like that game.
